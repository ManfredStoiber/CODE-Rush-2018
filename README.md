# CODE-Rush-2018
Our Results from the CO:DE Rush Hackathon 2018 in Coburg

The goal was, to make it possible to let Google Assistant search products for you in the Baur Online-Shop.
Please note, that we had only two days and I am just in the third semester of my Bachelor, so the code is not pretty, and some problems may not be solved very efficient :)
