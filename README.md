# CODE-Rush-2018
Our Results from the CO:DE Rush Hackathon 2018 in Coburg

The goal was, to make it possible to let Google Assistant search products for you in the Baur Online-Shop.
Please note, that we had only two days and I am just in the third semester of my Bachelor, so the code is not pretty, and some problems may not be solved very efficient :)

In CO_DE_Rush_Agent are the files from Google Dialogflow, which makes it able to communicate with Google Assistant. To use them, simply edit the project name and the webhook URL in the agent.json and import the files to your Google Dialogflow account.

The communication between Google Dialogflow and the Baur API is realized through the WebHook-Servlet.
